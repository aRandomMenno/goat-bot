# goat-bot
This is a python "program" to automaticly open crates in goat evolution. (might work on other evolution games from tapps games.)

You need to make your own screenshots of the sprites the crates and evolution crates. OTHERWISE IT WILL NOT WORK!!!
And ypu need to change the file path to the corresponding file path fo your computer.

# Yes very goed.

To get the program to work you need python. (Duh...)
Open cmd and do:
  pip install pyautogui
  pip install pillow
  pip install opencv-python
  
I hope thats it...

The things that are supposed to be for the berry is currently broken.
To stop the program move you mouse to the bottom right corner and that sould result in an error.
