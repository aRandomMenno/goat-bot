# goat-bot
This is a python "program" to automaticly open crates in goat evolution. (might work on other evolution games from tapps games.)

You need to make your own screenshots of the sprites the crates and evolution crates. OTHERWISE IT WILL NOT WORK!!! (note do not remove the "r" in front of the file path. PYHTON WILL CRY IF YOU DO!!)
And you need to change the file path to the corresponding file path for your computer.
The things that are supposed to be for the berries are currently broken.
To stop the program move you mouse to the bottom right corner and that sould result in an error.

# Install maybe...

To get the program to work you need python. (Duh...)
Open cmd and do:
  `pip install pyautogui`
  `pip install pillow`
  `pip install opencv-python`
  
I hope thats it...

# Scrcpy.

You also need something to get your phones screen on you laptop/computer.
I use this program:

You need to have "usb debugging" ENABLED on your device and have it connected to your computer/laptop otherwise it'll not work!
